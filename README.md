# CS 1030: Living in a Computing World (aka Computer Science Principles)
_Introductory Programming_
_(Tic-Tac-Toe with Ruby)_

* * *

__Note: IN PROGRESS__

* * * 

### Goals

1. Integrate the elements of the Ruby programming language you learned in the tutorial.
2. Gain experience with the implementation of a simple but self-contained computer application.
3. Take your first steps in object-oriented programming and see objects in action.
4. Learn how to use a version-control system and gain experience working with Github.
5. Learn to develop against a test suite. This is called test-driven development (TDD).
6. Learn to work against a requirements list.

### Synopsis



### Submission

You need to submit on the course's chosen learning management system the _url_ of your remote Github repository by the assignment deadline. 

Once you fork the repository (this is your **remote** repository on Github, aka **origin**), you will clone it to your development machine (this is your local repository), and start work on it. Commit your changes to your local repository often and push them up to the remote repository occasionally. Make sure you push at least once before the due date. At the due date, your remote repository will be cloned and tested automatically by the grading script. _**Note:** Your code should be in the **master** branch of your remote repository._

### Grading

An autograding script will run the test suite against your files. Your grade will be based on the number and weights of the tests passed. (E.g. if your code passes 3 out of 6 test cases, and all weights are equal, your score will be 50% and the grade will be the corresponding letter grade in the course's grading scale). **Note:** The testing and grading will be done with fresh original copies of the test suite files. You are free to modify them during development, but your changes will be discarded. Only your files relevant to the implementation of the requirements (game and computer player) will be used.

### Language

The language is Ruby. At the time of writing, Ruby 2.3.1 is the latest stable version and that will be used to run your code.

### Due date

The assignment is due on **Sun, Dec 4, at 23:59 Mountain time**. The last commit to your _tictactoe_ repository before the deadline will be graded.

### Honor code

Free Github repositories are public so you can look at each other's code. Please, don't do that. You can discuss any programming topics and the assignments in general but sharing of solutions diminishes the individual learning experience of many people. Assignments might be randomly checked for plagiarism and a plagiarism claim may be raised against you.

You can share all code and solutions within your team, of course.

### Coding style

You are expected to use [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) to develop this project. The IDE adheres (at least partially) to this [style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide). You are encouraged to follow it in general to the best of your ability and time, but especially the [Syntax](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#syntax) section.
